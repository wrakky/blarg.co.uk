  <em>
    Blarg is a unique word, being the only word that not only means anything you want it to, or is used
    to show disinterest or boredom, but also is the only word that thousands upon thousands of people have
    claimed to have made up but has been around since man discovered they could use tools.

###Why is Blarg so great?
There are many reasons with the main one being because it is.

###Is there any opposition to Blarg?
Unfortunately yes. The evil that is known as blerg has slowly been trying to corrupt the good people
of this earth and a small number of "blergites" have recently surfaced. If you spot a blergite it is a good
idea to try and convert them to the ways of blarg because there is hope for even the most lost cause.

###Is there any proof of blarg being better than blerg so I can try to convert these evil blergites?
Fear not my fellow Blarger! Here are but a few and there are many many more:

* Search for [blarg](http://www.google.com/search?q=blarg) on Google and you get way more results 
  than when you search for [blerg](http://www.google.com/search?q=blerg).
* [Blerg eats poor little kitties](http://www.cafepress.co.uk/goats_all/5480) and if that wasn't 
  enough it also tries to make money out of it!
* Blarg comes before blerg in the alphabet.
* [Multiple characters in fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blarg) have been named in honour of blarg.

### I know a blerger but they are lacking in mental capacity. Are there any visual examples that I can use to convert them?
A common problem but you are in luck my blarg loving friend. Here is a selection of photos that are 
sure to enlighten to even the most blarg sceptic of people.
