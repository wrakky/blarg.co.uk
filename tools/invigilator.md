### Security

####Protect yourself from bad extensions!

It has been reported in the media that people have been buying popular chrome extensions and injecting them with adware or
worse (see [http://www.labnol.org/internet/sold-chrome-extension/28377/](http://www.labnol.org/internet/sold-chrome-extension/28377/)
as an example). This transferring of ownership happens without you even knowing about it and once you realise it has happened the
damage could have already been done. Invigilator will warn you if the owner name of any extension you have installed has
changed which could indicate it has changed ownership. While this may not mean anything bad will happen, you will know to be extra vigilant.

Invigilator will also periodically check the reviews of your extensions and warn you when certain keywords are mentioned in them.
When adware or spyware is discovered people will often leave negative reviews to inform new users to stay away but existing users
are oblivious until they discover it for themselves.
